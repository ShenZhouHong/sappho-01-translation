### Rough translation
> On richly-worked throne immortal Aphrodite,
> child of Zeus, weaver of wiles, I pray to you,
> Do not overpower with sorrow and grief;
> Queen, my soul.

#### Translator's notes:
* μ' stems from ἐγώ
* The Liddell and Scott also gives an variety of possible translations for ἄσαισι, stemming from ἄση. Alternative meanings can include: surfeit, loathing, nausea, distress, vexation, or even longing and desire.
* μηδ᾽ is taken as μηδέ, which is a particle of negation.
* δάμνα as stemming from δαμνάω instead of the etymologically similar μι verb δάμνημι

### Stanza 2
> ἀλλὰ τυίδ' ἔλθ', αἴ ποτα κἀτέρωτα
> τὰς ἔμας αὔδας ἀίοισα πήλοι
> ἔκλυες, πάτρος δὲ δόμον λίποισα
>      χρύσιον ἦλθες

#### Rough translation
> But come hither if ever on the other side,
> of following my cry perceiving afar
> you heard, of your father's golden house leaving
> you went

#### Translator's notes:
* τυίδ' stemming from τυῖδε
* ἔλθ' is probably a enclitic form of deponent verb ἔρχομαι
* Supposedly κἀτέρωτα is Aeolic for ἑτέρωθι.
* πήλοι taken as the Aeolic τηλοῦ, according to the Liddell and Scott.
* πάτρος is father in the genitive. This translation assumes the same usage as in the phrase τὰ πρὸς πατρός.

### Stanza 3
> ἄρμ' ὐπασδεύξαισα· κάλοι δέ σ' ἆγον
> ὤκεες στροῦθοι περὶ γᾶς μελαίνας
> πύκνα δίννεντες πτέρ' ἀπ' ὠράνωἴθε-
>      ρος διὰ μέσσω·

#### Rough translation
> Your chariot under yoke, fetching with
> beautiful, swift sparrows circling close around the dark
> earth down from the heavens

#### Translator's notes:
* ὐπασδεύξαισα is compound, taking form of both ὑπο (lit. under) and the μι-verb ζεύγνυμι.
* δίννεντες was especially difficult to find in the dictionary, but eventually I took it as "to circle about"
* ἀπ' ὠράνωἴθερος appears to be some form of crasis, perhaps ὠράνου αἴθερος. It is glossed as "heaven" in my translation.

### Stanza 4
> αἶψα δ' ἐξίκοντο· σὺ δ', ὦ μάκαιρα,
> μειδιαίσαισ' ἀθανάτωι προσώπωι
> ἤρε' ὄττι δηὖτε πέπονθα κὤττι
>      δηὖτε κάλημμι

#### Rough translation
> They arrive suddenly, and you, oh Blessed one,
> Smiling, immortal face'd
> You ask that yet again who has wronged me.

#### Translator's notes
* Note that likewise μειδιαίσαισ is not standard Attic, but rather Aeolic of μειδιᾶν participle in aorist feminist singular.
* "Smiling, immortal face'd" is indeed an exceptionally ugly translation. However, this is just the rough translation, done with emphasis of speed and preservation of word-order. The final polished translation will be much nicer.
* κὤττι is the crasis form of καὶ ὄττι
* ἤρε Aeolic for ἐρωτᾶν?
* δηὖτε is poetic crasis for δὴ αὖτε
* κάλημμι is Attic of καλέω

### Stanza 5
> κὤττι μοι μάλιστα θέλω γένεσθαι
> μαινόλαι θύμωι· τίνα δηὖτε πείθω
> μαισ' ἄγην ἐς σὰν φιλότατα; τίς σ', ὦ
>      Ψά]πφ', ἀδικήει;

#### Rough translation
> And which is the exceeding desire of my soul
> Who I once again persuade to bring back into your love
> Oh Sappho, who is wronging you?

#### Translator's notes
* And once again, κὤττι is the crasis form of καὶ ὄττι
* μάλιστα is given as the superlative of μάλα
* δηὖτε is poetic crasis for δὴ αὖτε
* Taking ἄγην as the present infinitive form of ἀγάω

### Stanza 6
> καὶ γὰρ αἰ φεύγει, ταχέως διώξει,
> αἰ δὲ δῶρα μὴ δέκετ', ἀλλὰ δώσει,
> αἰ δὲ μὴ φίλει, ταχέως φιλήσει
>      κωὐκ ἐθέλοισα.

#### Rough translation
> And if for she flee, quickly she will chases,
> and if she gifts take not, she will give you.
> and if she loves you not, soon she will love
> and not willing

#### Translator's notes
* Here the sigma which denotes the future tense is merged in διώξει.
* Thankfully, the only complicated part of this stanza was the usage of κωὐκ, the crasis form of καῖ οὐκ
* The Aeolic ἐθέλοισα is the Attic ἐθελοῦσα. Note that it is feminine, hence the unrequited lover is a woman.

### Stanza 7
> ἔλθε μοι καὶ νῦν, χαλέπαν δὲ λῦσον
> ἐκ μερίμναν, ὄσσα δέ μοι τέλεσσαι
> θῦμος ἰμέρρει, τέλεσον, σὺ δ' αὔτα
>      σύμμαχος ἔσσο.

#### Rough translation
> and you come to me even now, resolve difficult
> from of thoughts, all things that my soul strongly wishes to
> accomplish, fulfilling, For you
> to fighting along with me

#### Translator's notes
* The scholar C.W. Conrad notes that the ἐκ is in tmesis, where it actually belongs to ἐκλῦσον, but is cut off in some reason. However translating it as a simple preposition seems to work out fine.
* Taking τέλεσσαι as the aorist optative.
* ἰμέρρει is another Aeolic superlative, most likely the Attic ἱμείρει.

## Technical Information
### Compiling document
In order to compile latex source files, run `make` in the terminal:
```
cd latex
make
make clean
```

Note: for any partial compiles where compilation fails at a certain point, you
should run `make clean` followed by make again. Trying to run make after a
failed compile would result in additional errors.

### Dependencies
This template uses a makefile to compile the latex source files. The makefile
uses `latexmk`, which runs latex the correct number of times. This is because
due to the presense of figures, tables, and biblatex databases, latex needs to
be called multiple times in some cases. Latexmk should be included in your
latex installation, but if it is now, you may download it here:

* http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8//software/latexmk-jcc/

Additionally, this template uses XeLaTeX by default, as it allows the inclusion
of unicode characters in the latex source files. If XeLaTeX is not installed, or
plain LaTeX is required, simply alter the `makefile` at the appropriate call:

```
# MAIN LATEXMK RULE
$(source_name).pdf: $(source_name).tex
  ...
	latexmk -pdf -xelatex -use-make $<
```

XeLaTeX allows one to use foreign characters like ü or æ natively in the latex
source files, though. So it's probably a good idea to install XeLaTeX:

* http://xetex.sourceforge.net/
